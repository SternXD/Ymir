# For developers:
#
# Try to keep vendored dependencies at a minimum to minimize bloat and make it easier for other
# developers to compile the code. Prefer including ports from vcpkg if possible, otherwise include
# them as submodules under this folder or the source tree if they're not git repos.
#
# If dependencies are included as submodules, explain why.
#
# find_package(...) can be used with any dependencies that misbehave (e.g. libraries that always
# include tests, or require tools that are unnecessary to consume it, like Python). Consider using
# a simpler alternative library, creating a custom CMakeLists.txt or manually building the target
# here from the source files.
# If you do add a library with find_package(...), list in the README so that other developers can
# provide them in the system to build this project.
