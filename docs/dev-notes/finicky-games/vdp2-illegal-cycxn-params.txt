Games that use illegal VRAM access cycle patterns
=================================================

Street Fighter Zero
Street Fighter Zero 2
Street Fighter Zero 3
Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge
Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire
  Sets up two consecutive accesses for NBG0 vertical cell scroll table during intro videos:
    CYCB1 = FFFFCCFF
  This causes every vertical cell scroll fetch for NBG0 to happen twice; the first value is discarded.

Rayman
  Sets up illegal vertical cell scroll fetch timing for NBG1, causing it to be delayed.

Capcom Generation - Dai-5-shuu Kakutouka-tachi 
  Sets up multiple character pattern read cycles for NBG0 bitmap data in VRAM bank B in the image gallery, causing the
  bottom portion of the image (starting at Y=256) to be shifted left. The game compensates for that in VRAM.
  This is in contrast with Doukyuusei - if, which sets up NBG0 and NBG1 with very similar parameters but sets up one
  pair of CP0s in VRAM A and one pair of CP1s in VRAM B, meaning each NBG reads only one bitmap chunk instead of two
  per cycle.

Battle Arena Toshinden Remix
  Sets up multiple PN accesses for NBG2 in-game to display UI elements.

Shichuu Suimei Pitagraph
  Sets up invalid CP accesses for NBG0 with 2x2 character patterns which causes them to be half-shifted forward.
